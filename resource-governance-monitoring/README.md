# Demo: Resource Governance Monitoring

## Objectives

FabricObserver 3.2.2 newest features adds notifications and telemetry for processes going over a percentage of the resource governance policy in Service Fabric.

Demo
- Telemetry shows average memory usage of processes in relation to resource governance policy
- Alerts for when the memory usage goes of a certain percentage

## Scenario configuration

## How to demo

1. Clone the repository with: git clone https://github.com/inputoutputcode/service-fabric-demos.git
2. Open the folder "resource-governance-monitoring/Scripts" in PowerShell.
3. Execute: .\01-Setup-AzureArtefacts.ps1 (15 mins in avg).
4. Open the URL of SFX copied from PowerShell (example: https://demo130904cluster.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080/Explorer/index.html).
5. Open the URL to the dashboard copied from PowerShell (example: http://demo130904cluster.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:8081).
6. Execute the URL for the API in web browers a couple of times to see the memory increase in dashboard (example: http://demo130904cluster.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:8081/api/staticstrings/1000)
7. By reaching 600 MB of memory FabricObserver should generate a warning in SFX about reaching 60% of the resource governance policy.
8. By reaching 1000 MB of memory you should see a OutOfMemoryException.
9. Open the URL for Application Insights to query the telemetry data, with enough data you get average memory consumption. Queries below.

## Showcases

The dashboard in the custom app to see memory usage real time:

The data in SFX for the memory usage threshold warning. In this case the application MemoryEater eats more than 600MB:

The telemetry data in Azure Application Insights, querying the weekly average in dashboard:

The telemetry data in Azure Application Insights, showing the real memory usage in relation to resource governance policy:

## Kusto queries

Query to show memory usage agains resource governance policy:
```
customEvents 
| where customDimensions['ApplicationTypeName'] == 'MemoryEaterAppType'
| where customDimensions['Metric'] == 'RG Memory Usage (Percent)'
| extend memoryRGLimit = toint(customDimensions['RGMemoryLimitMb'])
| extend memoryRGPercentageInMB = toint(todecimal(customMeasurements['RG Memory Usage (Percent)']) / 100 * memoryRGLimit)
| project timestamp, memoryRGPercentageInMB, memoryRGLimit
| render timechart
```

Query to show average memory usage over certain time for threshold evaluation:
```
customEventsÂ 
| where customDimensions['ApplicationTypeName'] == 'MemoryEaterAppType'
| where customDimensions['Metric'] == 'Memory Usage (MB)'
| extend memoryValue = toint(customMeasurements['Memory Usage (MB)'])
| summarize avg(memoryValue) by timestamp
| render timechart
```
